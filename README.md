# IntermediateCAD
My intermediate CAD assignments: advanced mechanical mates and design tables

## Design Tables
Assignment: Create a spool with a design table that has 7 size configurations with the hole in the middle suppressed in the two smallest configurations.

What I learned: How to use design tables to make multiple size configurations within one part.

Challenges: I struggled getting the spreadsheet to work because of some licensing/policy issue but the help desk fixed it.

Final product:

## Advanced Mechanical Mates
Assignment: Use new mate types to create this telescoping assembly with three size configurations of one part and a pin to hold them together.

What I learned: How to use new mates like the slot mate.

Challenges: Since I did some of it before my ultrasonic robot and some after it took me a day or two to redo the mates I'd made wrong.

Final product:
